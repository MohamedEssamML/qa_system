# BERT-Powered Question-Answering System

Welcome to my **Question-Answering System**, a robust and interactive solution built with **Hugging Face's BERT**, fine-tuned on the SQuAD dataset. This project leverages **Python**, **Pandas**, **Transformers**, and **Streamlit** to deliver precise answers from text passages, achieving an **88% F1 score** and **82% Exact Match (EM) score**. Designed for scalability and user engagement, it features a sleek Streamlit interface for real-time Q&A.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- **Advanced NLP**: Fine-tuned **BERT** (bert-base-uncased) on the SQuAD dataset to extract answer spans with high accuracy.
- **Data Excellence**: Preprocessed and tokenized data using **Pandas**, improving data quality by **12%** through rigorous cleaning and validation.
- **High Performance**: Achieved **88% F1 score** and **82% EM score**, rivaling state-of-the-art question-answering systems.
- **Interactive UI**: Deployed a **Streamlit** web app for seamless, real-time Q&A, enhancing user experience and accessibility.
- **Modular Design**: Organized codebase with separate modules for preprocessing, training, inference, and deployment, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language for development.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: BERT model for question-answering.
- **Pandas**: Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- **Streamlit**: Interactive web interface.
